Git & Bash

- Git (works with Github) is a distributed source control management tool.
- Bash is the shell we work in to interact with Git (same as command line)


Some useful commands
- 'exit' exits the program!
- 'pwd' basically asks "what directory am I in?" (print working directory)
- 'ls' lists everything within this directory.
	- 'ls -a' the '-a' is a flag, and a flag is passed to the 'ls' command to modify its output
	- 'ls -lah' everything after the dash '-' modifies the 'ls' output. '-l' shows a long output, '-a' shows all files, '-h' shows readble file
	sizes. Combining them into '-lah' gives your 'ls' output a modified look. 
- 'cd' change directory. If you're chaning directory into a folder with spaces use quotes. So directory Frontend Masters is "Frontend Masters"
- 'clear' clears console
- 'cd ~' the ~ is reference to your home directory for your user account. This will take you to your home directory.
- 'man' THIS WILL NOT WORK ON WINDOWS GIT BASH. Instead use --help so 'ls --help'
- '--help' will show more info about a particular command so 'ls --help' will show info and flags you can use with descriptions

- 'mkdir {name}' will create a new folder in the current directory. Ex: 'mkdir my-new-folder'
- 'touch {name}' will create a new file in the current directory. Ex: 'touch index.html'

- Add content to file
	- 'echo "<h1>Hello</h1>" > index.html' will echo (add) the h1 tag into the index.html file
- Read content from file
	- 'cat {name}' will print out the contents, so 'cat index.html'

- USEFUL, you can use tab completion if you start typing out a directory and hit tab. If there are too many similar results you'll
have to hit tab twice and it'll output all suggested results. You just need to keep typing more out of what you're searching for to
get the initial autocomplete to work

- HOW TO EXIT VIM (Git sometimes throws you in here)
	- Vim is a strange editor... that you might find yourself in!
	- In Git Bash type 'vi index.html' (given that file exists in the directory) and you'll be in Vim, where nothing works right!
		- Within Vim hit esc to get into command mode
		- You can use ':q' to quit, but it may give you a notice about not writing to the file
		- From here you can use ':w' to write first or combine ':wq' to write then quit to get out of Vim!

	- Vim is useful because it is on every server by default. If you know Vim you can remotely edit contents on another server and
	get out quickly.

Working with Git

- 'git init'
	- Initializes empty git repository in the project folder (adds a .git folder - source control)
